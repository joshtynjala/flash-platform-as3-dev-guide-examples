In order to get the test harness working, you will need to:
- Create a new Zorn Project
- Point the project path at the "test" folder
- Set the "bin" folder to be a sibling of "test" and "src" (the default puts it into "test")
- Add the "src" folder to the class path
- Add AsUnit 3.0 framework to the class path (www.asunit.org)
- Add the "ObjectOrientedProgramming/src" folder to the class path
- Set "StringSampleRunner.as" as DocumentRoot
- If you plan on using the debugger, add a permissions file to your player directory that permits all files in bin to avoid Security problems.
On my machine, this file is located at:

C:\Documents and Settings\lbayes\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player\#Security\FlashPlayerTrust

It can be given any name, it is a text file, and it's contents are (on my machine):

C:\Documents and Settings\[USER-DIR]\My Documents\projects\mm-samples\WorkingWithStrings\bin
